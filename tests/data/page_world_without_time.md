# World without time

How does a world without the notion of time we just destroyed look like? First it might be a good idea to stop thinking about things as permanent entities. It might be much better to think in terms of processes and events. As Aristotle stated, time is all about change.

Events have a beginning, a duration, and an end. They can be simple or composed of other simpler events. And they can have a relationship to other events, building a large network. _The author says we should think like this about the physical world. But could be the same line of thought applied when thinking about abstract concepts and ideas?_

In a world without time it is also very difficult to answer the question “What exists?” or “What is real?”. First, it is unclear what exactly we mean by the words “exist” and “real”. Is Pinocchio real? In some sense yes, in another no.

The other issue is that most people think in terms of presentism. Things exist only in the present. But as already discussed, there is no such thing as universal present.

There are also a few eternalists who claim that the future, the present and the past are all real. They all exist. But there is not enough evidence to support this view either.

In the end, the problem might be rooted in our language. We simply lack the linguistic tools to describe the universe how it really is.

Even when a dedicated time variable does not exist, things can still change relative to each other.
