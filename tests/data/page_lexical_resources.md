# Lexical resources

- Toolbox - contains dictionaries of words with PoS tagging, English translation, example sentences and more. Multiple languages
- Stopwords
- WordNet - Contains Synsets - sets of synonyms. Each synset offers definition, examples and list of lemmas. One lemma(word) can belong to multiple synsets. WordNet also defines a hierarchy of concepts. We can easily find hyponyms - words that are more specific (at one level below) or hypernyms - words that are more abstract. There are also other lexical relations such as meronyms (parts) and holonyms (containers). In case of verbs, there are entailments (a sub-action being a part of a larger action). WordNet also defines acronyms. We can also detect hypernyms common for multiple synsets, determine their level of specificity by checking their depth in the concept hierarchy, or calculate similarity by determining the ratio of their path from the root being shared.
