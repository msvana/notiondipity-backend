# The Crumbling of Time

Time runs slower when we are close to a center of gravity. We can observe this effect even on earth. Given very precise clocks, it’s possible to measure that time passes faster in the mountains that at sea level. According to Einstein’s general relativity, this is what causes gravity. Actually every point in space has its own local time. There is no unified global time. 

Next issue is direction. Time flows from the past to the future. But this direction does not seem to be an inherent property. It might instead emerge from the second law of thermodynamics. This law is about entropy. It says that entropy in a closed system can only increase or stay the same at best. 

Entropy essentially measures the number of microstates of the system between which we can’t distinguish. If we had the ability to distinguish between all possible microstates, then the distinction between the past and the future would cease to exist.

Even at the same point in space time flows differently for objects moving at different speeds. We can measure the difference even on earth, for example on a plane. As a consequence, the notion of “now” or “the present” is a local phenomenon. It makes no sense to ask what’s happening now on Saturn. It’s a nonsensical question. Given that the time resolution of our brains is about one tenth of a second, at the very best the concept of “now” makes sense only when discussing what’s happening on Earth.

One way to look at this issue is to say that there is only partial cause-effect order between events occurring in our universe. Some events cause other events. But there is no single cause and effect chain. And if we consider the discussion on the directionality of time, the cause and effect relationship stops making sense.

We can visualize this partial order as a cone on a space-time diagram. The shape of this cone is determined by the speed of light. And because the passage of time depends on location and speed, each object in the universe has its own cone with different rotation.

We can at least define a concept of “extended present”. It includes any event not in our past or and not in our future. Events not in our past cone can’t influence us and we can’t influence events that are not in our future cone:

# Independence of Time

Aristotle saw time as a measure of change. If nothing changes, than there is no time. Newton held an opposite view, he thought that there is some sort of an absolute true time that is independent from all other phenomena. 

Einstein unified both these views in his general theory of relativity. He says that there indeed is some sort of an absolute true time and space. However, it is not independent. Objects with mass can bend it and slow it down. Another name for this spacetime of Einstein’s is gravitational field. And it interacts with other fields, just as any other field does.

But it gets even more interesting if we add quantum mechanics to the mix. It makes time quantized or discrete. Time is not continuous. There is a smallest possible interval of time called Planck time which is about 10^-44 seconds. Time intervals smaller than this number stop making sense. Quantum mechanics also makes the gravitational field indeterminate. Instead of having exact value at each point in space, we get a probability distribution. We should imagine those famous pictures of Einstein’s spacetime as blurry. In a quantum world each object is at a superposition of multiple states. This superposition collapses into a normal state only after it interacts with some other object. And although these two objects now “know” each other’s state, for the rest of the universe there is now a superposition of their shared state.
