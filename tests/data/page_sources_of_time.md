# Sources of time

So we have seen that time as we perceive it does not really exist. And it doesn’t have to for our universe to work. So what’s the source of the notion of time we use in our everyday lives? 

Time seems to be emergent.

It might be our ignorace — our inability to see every detail of the world around us. We only see its macrostate — a blur. The typical causal chain we think about is that as time flows, the energy distribution of a system changes. This energy distribution change changes the macrostate. But what if it’s the other way around? We see a change in the macrostate, hence we assume that the energy distribution has changed. Time emerges from this change.

The direction of time is then determined by entropy. As time flows, entropy can only increase. But entropy is a relative measure. Similarly to speed, it can only be measured relatively given an observer. And as already discussed, entropy emerges only because of the blur caused by the fact that can’t perceive all variables in a system. 

Why is it that entropy was lower at the “beginning of time”? This can be explained by a card analogy. Let’s have a deck of 12 cards. Lets arrange it in such a way that there are 6 black cards at the top and 6 red cards at the top. We start in this special position and shuffle the deck. As we are shuffling this deck it appears more and more random. Its entropy is increasing.

The deck started in a “special” configuration. But it could have started at any other configuration. We could make this configuration “special” by memorizing it and marking it as the starting position in our minds. 

Because of our limited perception we might have unconsciously marked some state of the universe as special. And in a sense it might be. The universe is vast and there is a non-zero probability that a small part of it will be configured in way that gives rise to what we call time and life. 

This line of thinking has implications for doing research, especially in natural sciences. Although we are trying to arrive to some objective truth about the universe, we should keep in mind that we are looking at the universe from a particular limited viewpoint.

Entropy plays an important role in our lives. We generally think that what we need to do stuff is energy. But this statement doesn’t make sense if we consider the first law of thermodynamics — conservation of energy. 

What we need instead is sources of lower entropy that we can increase. An example of a such source is sun. For each high-energy photon our planet gets from sun, it emits 10 low-energy photons. A single high-energy photon has lower energy than 10 low-energy photons.

The growth of entropy is not linear. A system can stay in a low entropy state for a long time until suddenly something triggers a high entropy increase. Wood can barely increase its entropy if left alone. But start a fire and it burns rapidly.

We remember the past and not the future because events in the past leave traces. These traces have the form of heat — an increase in entropy. The presence of these traces is what makes the past feel determined and their absence is what makes the future seem open and uncertain. The evolution gave us mechanisms to “decide” what to do in the future. These mechanisms are based on modeling the relationships between causes and effects. Causes are always in the past, effects are always in the future. When thinking about the future we make hypotheses about what small changes in the the present state would cause what effects. That said, physical laws are symmetrical. They work the same in reverse. Hence on the basic level there is no distinction between causes and effects. 

## Time and us

How are we, individual human beings, related to time? Our identity has several components:

- We are a network of related processes and events. We are not a standalone entity.
- We are also a point of view that observes the universe.
- We understand our identity by observing the world around us. More specifically other people.
- We have a memory, a history, a narrative.

The last aspect is the most important in relation to time. Memory represents traces that “past” events left in our brains. In a sense, our past exists in our brains, just as the present does. And so does anticipation. Our whole perception of time exists in our brains all at once. This is why we are able to perceive time and duration.
