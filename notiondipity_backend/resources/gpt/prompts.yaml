adjacent_possible:
  prompt: |
    Adjacent possible refers to the idea that innovation and creativity are not sudden breakthroughs but are 
    built upon existing ideas and conditions. It suggests that new ideas and possibilities emerge from the space 
    that is adjacent or connected to what already exists. The adjacent possible is like a network of possibilities
    that expand as existing elements combine and recombine in novel ways. Each innovation or breakthrough opens up
    new adjacent possibilities for further exploration and development.

    What are the adjacent possibilities of these pages? What are the ideas that are adjacent to the ideas
    in these pages? What are the ideas that are connected to the ideas in these pages? Be creative and innovative.
